_Overview_<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this analysis is to get us comforatble with Tableau. Not only with its fuctionality, but with its ability to manipulate data and to give a visual representation of data. It is important to not only create a visualization with data, but an actual visual story that will give our data gravity and we are able to point the reader in the right direction in what we have found in the data. Possibly even advise/offer ideas based on the information that is shown.
