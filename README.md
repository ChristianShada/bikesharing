# NYCiti Bikesharing Program
## Part 1
_Overview_<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this analysis is to get us comforatble with Tableau. Not only with its fuctionality, but with its ability to manipulate data and to give a visual representation of data. It is important to not only create a visualization with data, but an actual visual story that will give our data gravity and we are able to point the reader in the right direction in what we have found in the data. Possibly even advise/offer ideas based on the information that is shown.<br><br>

## Part 2
_Results_<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When looking at this data, it was easy to understand that these results are showing that bikes are taken out for no longer than one hour.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This data shows us the differentiation between men and women and others who ride bikes. That data shows us that in fact men bike a great deal more than women. At least when using Citi Bank Bike Sharing.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When viewing this data, we are shows when the bikes are used. The darker the red the more heavier the traffic is. The lighter the yellow, the less bike traffic. This will also allow the company to figure out when to service the bikes. I'd suggest early in the morning when people are traditionally asleep.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This view allows us to break down what gender is renting bikes and when. As it is in coordination of the previous heat graph, this just dials it in more to gender. Here again, we do see more of a male presence upon rentals. However females use the bikes as well. Perhaps there can be marketing that is directed to the Female population.<br><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This last visualization shows us that people who who are subsrubers are much more prone to rent the bikes, versus the customers. This lends us an opportunity to create a subsriber program to enice others to join.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

## Part 3
_Summary_<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working through these different visualization was difficult at first, however the more practice I hd the better the results and the higher understanding I received. What I enjoyed in particular was the ability to manipulate the data in such a way that it took the csv file and created different kinds of visuals. Through this understanding, I would suggest two marketing campaigns to create more business. <br><br>
SUGGESTION 1: Subscription encicement. It is obvious that the program is more successful when there is subscribed ridership. It would be more luctrative if we can take those already customers and convert them to be subscribers rather than just customers.<br><br>
SUGGESTION 2: Women. Citibank Rideshare is lacking in women customers and subscribers. It is important that we reach out to both of them to add to our customer and subsriber base.
